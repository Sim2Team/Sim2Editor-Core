# Sim2Editor-Core
Sim2Editor's JavaScript Core written by SuperSaiyajinStackZ.

This Core is being used for [Sim2Editor](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Sim2Editor)'s web version. I decided to do the Core External, so other apps can make use of this as well, if needed for whatever reason.

## Core Usage
For that, look at the coming soon:tm: wiki. It will also contain documentation about each Core function, so you can see what you'd need.

## Credits
- [SuperSaiyajinStackZ](https://github.com/SuperSaiyajinStackZ): Main Developer of the Core + Main SAV Researcher.
