# Sim2Editor-Core

Sim2Editor's JavaScript Core written by SuperSaiyajinStackZ.

This Core is being used for [Sim2Editor](https://github.com/SuperSaiyajinStackZ/Sim2Editor)'s web version. I decided to do the Core External, so other apps can make use of this as well, if needed for whatever reason.

If you want to see the core in action, feel free to go to my [Sim2Editor](https://supersaiyajinstackz.github.io/Sim2Editor) site and try it out! ;P


## Core Usage

For that, look at the coming soon:tm: wiki. It will also contain documentation about each Core function, so you can see what you'd need.
